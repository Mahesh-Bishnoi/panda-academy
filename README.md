# 🐼 Panda Academy

Panda Academy is a web-based academic scheduling system that helps manage courses, teachers, classrooms, and automated timetable generation for each semester.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project is built with a **Spring Boot backend** and a **React frontend**.  
It provides functionality for:
- Generating class schedules automatically based on constraints (teachers, classrooms, times)
- Viewing generated timetables
- Tracking scheduling failures and remaining availability for teachers/classrooms

---

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
The backend will start at:

👉 https://localhost:8080

Just starting the backend and visiting localhost is enough.
